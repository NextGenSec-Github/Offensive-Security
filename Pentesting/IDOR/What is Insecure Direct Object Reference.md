# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application exposes sensitive data or functionality by referencing an internal object such as a file, database record, or resource directly, without proper authorization checks. Attackers exploit IDOR vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to resources or manipulate data.

## How IDOR Works
In a typical web application, objects such as user accounts, files, or database records are stored with unique identifiers (IDs). These IDs are used in URLs, parameters, or hidden fields to retrieve or manipulate the corresponding objects. Insecure Direct Object References arise when:

- **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The application fails to validate the user's authorization before serving requested objects. This allows attackers to access unauthorized resources by manipulating the object references.
- **Predictable Object References:** When the application uses predictable or sequential identifiers for objects, attackers can easily guess or enumerate these IDs to access sensitive data.

## Examples of IDOR

### Example 1: Unauthorized File Access
- Suppose a web application allows users to view their uploaded files through URLs like https://example.com/files?id=123. However, the application fails to verify if the logged-in user has permission to access file ID 123. An attacker can simply change the ID parameter to view other users' files.

Vulnerable URL:


```
https://example.com/files?id=123
```

Exploitable URL (Attacker accessing another user's file):
```bash
https://example.com/files?id=456
```

### Example 2: Manipulating User Data
Consider a banking application where users can view their account details via URLs like https://examplebank.com/account?id=123. If the application lacks proper authorization checks, an attacker can modify the ID parameter to access other users' accounts and perform unauthorized transactions.

Vulnerable URL:
```bash
https://examplebank.com/account?id=123
```

Exploitable URL (Attacker accessing another user's account):
```bash
https://examplebank.com/account?id=456
```

## Mitigating IDOR Vulnerabilities
To prevent Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerabilities, developers should implement the following best practices:

1. **Access Controls:** Enforce proper authorization checks to ensure users have permission to access requested objects.

2. **Use Indirect References:** Avoid exposing internal object identifiers directly to users. Instead, use random or non-sequential references that are not easily guessable.

3. **Validate Input:** Sanitize and validate user input to prevent manipulation of object references through parameters, URLs, or hidden fields.

4. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define user roles and permissions, and enforce access controls based on these roles to restrict unauthorized access.

5. **Audit Logs:** Keep detailed logs of user activities and access attempts to detect and investigate any unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.

By adhering to these practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of IDOR vulnerabilities and protect sensitive data within their applications.
