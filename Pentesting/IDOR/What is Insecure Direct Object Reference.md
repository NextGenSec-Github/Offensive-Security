# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application exposes sensitive data or functionality by referencing an internal object such as a file, database record, or resource directly, without proper authorization checks. Attackers exploit IDOR vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to resources or manipulate data.

## How IDOR Works
In a typical web application, objects such as user accounts, files, or database records are stored with unique identifiers (IDs). These IDs are used in URLs, parameters, or hidden fields to retrieve or manipulate the corresponding objects. Insecure Direct Object References arise when:

- **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The application fails to validate the user's authorization before serving requested objects. This allows attackers to access unauthorized resources by manipulating the object references.
- **Predictable Object References:** When the application uses predictable or sequential identifiers for objects, attackers can easily guess or enumerate these IDs to access sensitive data.

## Examples of IDOR

### Example 1: Unauthorized File Access
- Suppose a web application allows users to view their uploaded files through URLs like https://example.com/files?id=123. However, the application fails to verify if the logged-in user has permission to access file ID 123. An attacker can simply change the ID parameter to view other users' files.

Vulnerable URL:
bash```https://example.com/files?id=123```
